Subject: Thrilled to Share My Win at the Salesforce Global AI Hackathon!

Hi Nishit,

I’m excited to share that I recently participated in the Salesforce AgentForce Global AI Hackathon and was awarded the “Best Integration of Slack” prize for my project, EcoZen.

EcoZen is an AI-powered sustainability agent designed to drive carbon-conscious decision-making across enterprise infrastructure. EcoZen integrates with Climatiq's carbon emission index, Slack, and Salesforce Data Cloud to look at how servers in AWS, Azure, and GCP are utilized in real-time. It identifies carbon inefficiencies ahead of time, suggests greener alternatives, and sends targeted nudges through Slack to prompt timely action. The solution also automatically creates weekly summaries that show trends in emissions and ways to improve things. Interactive dashboards let you see CO₂ reduction, cloud efficiency, and sustainability metrics that are specific to your region. EcoZen demonstrates how combining AI and platforms can make a significant difference in the way technology is utilized to support the environment.
