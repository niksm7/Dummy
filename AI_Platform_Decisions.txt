Arguments

- Research shows that Copilot Studio “is likely your starting point” only if you need quick, low‑code agents that reach into M365/Teams.
In contrast, Azure AI Foundry is designed to “connect to enterprise data sources” and wire agents into services like Azure Cognitive Search or any REST endpoint

- Azure AI Foundry is expressly designed for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with Advanced data indexing. Microsoft highlights that Foundry “specializes in advanced AI capabilities like RAG”
And complex RAG is the main pillar of our project, which does heavy code analysis and performs detailed actions involving various multi-step features.

- Our future vision involves multiple specialized agents with a supervisor agent. 
Both platforms support multi-agent orchestration, but in different styles. 
Copilot Studio has a built‑in “multi-agent orchestration” feature that lets multiple bots collaborate under Teams workflows. 
Azure AI Foundry provides an “Agent Service” specifically for orchestrating complex, multi-agent systems. 
In practice, Azure’s Agent Service is designed for production-grade agent networks (with CI/CD, monitoring, etc.), while Copilot’s multi-agent is more of a high-level flow builder. 
Thus, both can do multi-agent, but Azure’s approach is more scalable and customizable for enterprise use.
