I recently competed in the Salesforce AgentForce Global AI Hackathon, where my team won the "Best Integration of Slack" award for EcoZen, an AI-powered sustainability agent designed to drive carbon-conscious decision-making across enterprise infrastructure.  EcoZen integrates with Climatiq's carbon emission index, Slack, and Salesforce Data Cloud to look at how servers in AWS, Azure, and GCP are utilized in real time.  It discovers carbon inefficiencies ahead of time, suggests greener alternatives, and sends smart nudges through Slack to get timely action.  The solution also automatically creates weekly summaries that show trends in emissions and ways to improve things. Interactive dashboards let you see CO₂ reduction, cloud efficiency, and sustainability metrics that are specific to your region.  EcoZen shows how combining AI and platforms can make a big difference in the way technology is used to help the environment.
